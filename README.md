### What is this?

This is plugin for IntelliJ to analyze source code and build few histograms:
 - amount of 'if' statements per method
 - amount of loops per method
 - amount of fields per class
 - amount of methods per class

To run it you will need this [live-plugin](https://github.com/dkandalov/live-plugin)

(Note that it's still work-in-progress.)
